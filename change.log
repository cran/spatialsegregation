2.10:
 - change functions' value to fv-class from package-spatstat: Now support for e.g. envelope, plot
 - BIG CHANGES! Probably not combatible with previous versions 
 - removed the 'ratio'-parameter, no need
 - commented the code more
 - better documentation
 - writing this at 00:55-2009-09-06

2.06:
 - fix the print error of ISAR
2.05:
 - fix CRAN compilation errors 
 
2.04:
 - changed the k-nn graph so that if some nodes don't have enough precalculated neighbours (n<k) it skip the node, not the whole pattern
2.03:
 - fixed the prepGraph-problem
2.02:
 - fixed the geometric graph bug when a prepR was not given
 
2.01:
 - added possibility to use prepGraph directly for calculation
 
2.00:
 - added dependecy of spatstat
 - added degree-weighted isar
 
1.96:
 - fixed the nonfunctioning prepGraph-problem
1.95:
 - added the shannon v2, which uses the real typecount in the neighbourhoods as the log base instead of always S
1.94:
 - removed dependence of 'spatgraphs'
 
1.93:
 - removed bcisubsample-function
 - documentations are now acceptable
 
1.92:
 - added the pp modifiers from art2data
1.91:
 - corrected the Shannon calculation, does not discard types as targets but only 
   as sources
1.9:
 - removed calculating over the empty types (!included) from Simpson and Shannon.
1.8:
 - workaround for the 'markformat(x)==none' point pattern problem
 
1.7:
 - added the weighted mean to mingling and ISAR

1.4:
 - clean up the functions to more generic form
 - write documentation
 - general cleaning of code, fix warnings "comparing int...unsigned int..."
1.3:
 - added function class fcl for plotting
 - added poisson values to the returned values for comparison
