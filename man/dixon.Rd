\description{
Dixon's 2-type contingency table tests
}
\details{
Computes the tests of segregation using nearest neighbour contingency tables introduced 
by Philip Dixon in his paper "Testing spatial segregation using a nearest-neighbor contingency table",
Ecology, 75, p.1940-1948 (1994). The tests are an improvement on the Pielou's test of segregation.
The test is defined only for two-type spatial pattern.
